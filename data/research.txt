Some Current Projects

Definiteness and anaphora crosslinguistically | This cross-linguistic collaborative project led by Ankana Saha investigates how discourse structure shapes the use of referential expressions, like definite and demonstrative descriptions, and seeks to identify the pragmatic constraints that regulate their acceptability. | This project focuses on the behavior of demonstratives in anaphoric contexts. Contrary to prior views that anaphora does not contribute any novel insights to our theory of definites and demonstratives, this work shows that anaphora is a striking diagnostic that highlights pragmatic differences between these expressions. By integrating cross-linguistic experimental data from languages with and without overt definiteness marking (English, Bangla, Turkish, German, Mandarin), the project presents evidence for robust distinctions between anaphoric definite and demonstrative descriptions, shaped by factors such as situational change and focus-sensitive alternatives. The consistent experimental findings suggest a deep conceptual universality underlying the definite–demonstrative contrast, paving the way for a nuanced, formally explicit model of context-sensitive definite reference that captures both grammatical and pragmatic discourse constraints. | [Saha et al. 2024](https://journals.linguisticsociety.org/proceedings/index.php/SALT/article/view/34.011), [Saha et al. 2023](https://journals.linguisticsociety.org/proceedings/index.php/SALT/article/view/33.023), [Saha & Davidson 2024](https://improved-doodle-7vxjg56w45rvfrjxp-5511.app.github.dev/documents/saha_davidson-xprag_2024_demonstratives_poster.pdf)

Adjective-noun composition in humans and large language models | This project, led by Hayley Ross along with Najoung Kim (Boston University), explores compositionality through the lens of experimental semantics, specifically focusing on adjective-noun composition with so-called privative adjectives like fake or counterfeit in human languages and language models. |Hayley works on compositionality through the lens of experimental semantics, specifically focusing on adjective-noun composition with so-called privative adjectives like fake or counterfeit. How do humans conclude that a fake door isn't a door, but a counterfeit paintingis still a painting? Can large language models, which are just trained on reading vast quantities of text, arrive at the same conclusions? In particular, Hayley is studying how both humans and language models extend this to cases they haven't seen before, such as counterfeit skirt, and whether their generalisations are best formalised by existing theories (Martin, 2022; del Pinal, 2018) or rather a probabilistic approach. Hayley's previous projects within the lab also include experimental work on crossover (what pronouns can refer to in sentences like The teacher knew whose project they found frustrating.)|[Ross et al. 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24293), [Ross et al. 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17482), [Ross et al. 2024](https://lingbuzz.net/lingbuzz/008012)

Cross-Modal Investigation of Manner: English, Turkish, and Turkish Sign Language| This project led by Hande Sevgi investigates how listeners and signers interpret manner vs. path information across speech, gesture, and sign. | The work asks how modifiers like “quickly” or “noisily” compare to time or locative adverbs in interpretation. In English, results show path is treated as a core event component, while manner is more flexible and context-sensitive. In Turkish, manner adverbs and ideophones behave differently under negation, focus, and information structure, introducing distinct discourse alternatives. In sign languages, the project looks at how classifier modifications encode manner and how they interact with negation. Together these findings point toward a multimodal theory of event modification, integrating speech, sign, and gesture, and will be extended with real-time processing studies. | [Sevgi 2024](https://drive.google.com/file/d/190i4XrxCzg_hCF3OH1dUTZCH9kgBKjKe/view?pli=1)

Scrambling in Hindi | This project led by Nayantara Das uses experimental methods to study local vs. long-distance scrambling in Hindi. | Hindi has both clause-internal (local) scrambling and long-distance scrambling (LDS) that crosses finite clauses. Local scrambling has been noted to extend scope, optionally reconstruct, and avoid weak-crossover effects; LDS has been argued to obligatorily reconstruct and create weak-crossover effects, though it is marginal for many speakers. This project develops experimental paradigms to test LDS scope properties. Early results suggest both scope extension and reconstruction are possible, challenging prior claims that the two movements differ categorically and raising questions for theories deriving weak-crossover from obligatory reconstruction. The work contributes new empirical data and motivates refined theoretical accounts of scrambling.

Presupposition filtering in disjunction in Mandarin: What role does exclusive interpretation play? | This project led by Yiqian Wang investigates whether presupposition filtering in disjunctions is modulated by exclusive interpretation. | The project builds on Kalomoiros and Schwarz (2024), which propose that exclusive interpretation reduces filtering. Yiqian’s Mandarin experiments instead found the opposite: greater exclusivity enhances filtering. This surprising pattern suggests that the relationship between exclusivity and presupposition filtering is more complex than existing theories predict. Future work will extend the paradigm to English to test the robustness and generality of the effect across languages, with implications for how we model presupposition projection and exclusivity in formal semantics.

Experimental investigation of (in)definiteness in a language without articles: the case of Russian | This project led by Daria Bikina explores how speakers of Russian, a language without articles, understand whether a noun refers to something definite or indefinite. Through a series of experiments, it investigates how factors like word order, prosody, and interaction with various contexts shape the interpretation of bare nouns and tests the predictions of recent semantic frameworks suggested for article-less languages. The project also includes parallel experiments in English, which provide cross-linguistic contrasts.

QUD (Question Under Discussion)-sensitivity of attitude reports with a `third reading’ | This project led by Yurika Aonuki to experimentally test the hypothesis that availability of transparent readings in attitude reports is sensitive to the QUD (Percus 2020, (Percus 2020; Benbaji-Elhadad 2023; Mayr and Schmitt 2023, 2024). The project currently focuses on what are called “third readings” (Fodor 1970), in which the existential quantifier of an indefinite DP in an attitude complement scopes below the attitude verb, but the descriptive content of the DP is interpreted transparently.

Pragmatic competence of artificial language systems | This project, led by Ankana Saha along with Jennifer Hu (Johns Hopkins University), uses definite and demonstrative descriptions in anaphora as a case study to assess pragmatic competence in large language models. | Recent advances in language models have prompted renewed inquiry into whether pragmatic competence can arise from exposure to statistical patterns of use. While several benchmarks test LMs on implicature or discourse coherence, it has been less explored whether they track fine-grained informational-structural constraints as humans do. This project investigates pragmatically modulated preferences between definite and demonstrative descriptions in anaphoric contexts. Comparing LMs’ behavior to human data helps clarify the extent to which statistical learning captures humanlike pragmatic constraints and also informs theories of human processing of definites and demonstratives.


Past Projects

Pragmatic inferences triggered by the iconic use of space in sign and in gesture | This experimental project led by Anastasia Tsilia focuses on whether co-speech gestures can license complement anaphora with positive quantifiers like ‘most’. She investigates the interaction of negation with iconicity, more specifically, the iconic inferences of existence triggered by iconic loci in American Sign Language (ASL) as well as by iconic co-speech gestures in English. |Anastasia is interested in the semantics and pragmatics of co-speech gestures. She previously worked on an experimental project with Kathryn Davidson, focusing on whether co-speech gestures can license complement anaphora (e.g., Few students came. They (=the ones who did not come) stayed home) with positive quantifiers like ‘most’. She is currently investigating the interaction of negation with iconicity, as well as the pragmatic inferences triggered by the iconic use of space both in signed and in spoken language. More specifically, she is working on the iconic inferences of existence triggered by iconic loci in ASL as well as by iconic co-speech gestures in English. She is also thinking about the environments in which these inferences are (in)compatible with negation and negative quantifiers. 

Investigating embedding and the role of non-manuals in ASL imperatives | This  project led by Marianthi Koraka investigates the possible manual and non-manual elements that are used for the expression of imperative speech acts in American Sign Language (ASL). | In this project, Marianthi Koraka is interested in the possible manual and non-manual elements that are used for the expression of four imperative speech acts, namely command, plea, permission and advice as well as in whether ASL imperatives can be truly embedded under particular verbs, such as SAY, COMMAND, BEG and whether there is any particular evidence in favor of true embedding (see for instance the diagnostics suggested by Davidson and Caponigro (2016), like topicalization, negation and binding, for polar interrogatives in ASL). Another question that they will try to answer concerns the specific role of non-manual elements in imperatives (that are often considered to act the same way as intonation in spoken languages), namely whether they are part of the imperative convention or whether they act more independently.

Interpreting noun phrases in belief reports – the de re/de dicto competition | This project led by Yuhan Zhang investigates the empirical landscape of de re/de dicto acceptability by using an experimantal behavioral methods. They aim to solidify the empirical foundation for formal semantic theory development and endorse the practice of collecting reliable empirical judgment data for nuanced semantic phenomena. |The de re/de dicto ambiguity centers on the referential and/or attributive properties of noun phrases in the scope of intentional operators such as attitude or belief reports. For the belief report Julie believes Elizabeth’s poem will win the competition, a de re reading of the embedded referential noun phrase Elizabeth’s poem entails that the referential association between this noun phrase and the target poem is true from the perspective of the speaker; but the belief holder (e.g. Julie) does not register such association in her mind. In contrast, a de dictoreading entails that the belief holder Julie does register this association and knows the poem was written by Elizabeth. While both the de re and de dicto readings of definite noun phrases like Elizabeth’s poem are generally available given supporting contexts, we find that the acceptability of de re reading is subject to contextual and pragmatic manipulations. Yuhan's research is the first that utilizes experimental behavioral methods to systematically lay out the empirical landscape of de re/de dicto acceptability. Their findings aim to solidify the empirical foundation for formal semantic theory development and endorse the practice of collecting reliable empirical judgment data for nuanced semantic phenomena.| [Zhang & Davidson 2024](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/71c5p23s), [Zhang & Davidson 2021](https://journals.linguisticsociety.org/proceedings/index.php/ELM/article/view/4874)
