# People
current | Kathryn Davidson | Director of the Meaning and Modality Laboratory, Professor of Linguistics |Kathryn Davidson is a Professor in the Department of Linguistics at Harvard University.  Her research investigates the unique capacity that we have to understand an infinite number of sentences that we've never heard before (semantics), how we incorporate contextual information into these meanings (pragmatics), and how we ever learn to do this (development). Kate is especially interested in what we can learn about linguistic meaning from visual language, both in full natural languages like American Sign Language and in co-speech gestures to spoken languages like English. Her background is in math and theoretical linguistics, and in her research she makes balanced use of theory for hypothesis creation with psycholinguistic experimental methods for gathering and analyzing data. Kate received her Ph.D. in Linguistics from the University of California, San Diego, and her B.A. in Mathematics and Linguistics from the University of Pennsylvania. Prior to joining Harvard, she was a Postdoctoral Associate in Cognitive Science at Yale University, and before that a Postdoctoral Fellow in Linguistics at the University of Connecticut. | kate.jpeg | alt=white woman with brown hair on a bridge across a river
alumni | Irene Canudas | Postdoctoral fellow | Irene is a postdoctoral researcher investigating the intricate connection between language and cognition. Her primary focus lies in dissecting the fundamental conceptual elements that play a crucial role in scaffolding language acquisition. Her recent projects include work on understanding of logical structure and quantification in infancy, as well as children’s understanding of alternative possibilities. Currently, her research revolves around exploring how events are represented in the absence of language. | irene.png | alt= Irene, a woman with glasses and brown hair, smiling
current | Nozomi Tomita|Postdoctoral fellow in Linguistics| Nozomi is a postdoctoral researcher at the Meaning Modality Lab at Harvard University. Her primary interests revolve around the intricate interplay between form and meaning within linguistic structures, with a special emphasis on multi-modalities encompassing both signed and spoken languages. She delves into the fascinating process of how experiences with language become conventionalized, expressed through specific linguistic forms, and evolve over time. One of her recent research endeavors explores the intriguing phenomenon of polysemous handshapes used in words from the Japanese metaphor 'Argument Is War,' which stands as one of her compelling research topics.|nozomi.jpg|alt=Nozomi, a Japanese woman with shoulder-length black hair and a purple shirt smiles in front of a green background
current | Daria Bikina | Graduate student, Harvard Linguistics | Daria (Dasha) is a graduate student in the Linguistics Department. Her research interests are in experimental semantics and syntax-semantics interface. She is currently working on the interpretation of DPs in Russian and its interaction with information structure and aspect. Coming from a linguistic fieldwork background, Daria is particularly interested in methodology of linguistic experimental research. | daria.jpg | alt=Daria smiles, wearing a purple coat and a winter hat
current | Jian Cui | Graduate student, Harvard Linguistics | Jian is a graduate student in linguistics and has interests in language acquisition and related experimental work.| jian.jpg | alt=Jian,a woman with short dark hair and a blue striped shirt, smiles
current | Nayantara Das |Graduate student, Harvard Linguistics |Nayantara is a first-year graduate student interested in formal and experimental semantics. | nayantara.jpg | alt=Nayantara, a woman with curly dark brown hair and glasses, smiling at the camera
current | James Lee|Graduate student, Lab manager|James is a third-year graduate student in linguistics, studying semantics and syntax-semantics interface.|james.png|alt=James, a man with black hair and glasses wearing a leather jacket stands in front of a painted mural

alumni | Hayley Ross|Graduate student, Harvard Linguistics|Hayley is a graduate student in Linguistics working on theoretical and experimental semantics, as well as computational linguistics. Her current experimental work focuses on anaphora and crossover. On the computational side, Hayley is especially interested in how compositionality - a key feature of human language - relates to modern attempts to reproduce language in large (neural) language models. Her background is in mathematics (specifically logic) and computer science, and she balances  theoretical formalism and careful experimental work throughout her research.|hayley.jpg|alt=Hayley, a white woman with long red hair and glasses, smiles
current | Ankana Saha|Graduate student, Harvard Linguistics| Ankana is a sixth-year graduate student in the Department of Linguistics. Her work focuses on semantics and its interfaces with pragmatics and syntax. She is particularly interested in investigating issues pertaining to the nominal domain like the semantics of bare nouns in languages with and without determiners, kind reference, number marking, definiteness, demonstratives, anaphora, and the cross-linguistic variability in the expression of epistemic indefinites. She explores these issues using a mix of formal theory, experimental methods, and fieldwork, with an empirical focus on South Asian languages. In her current collaborative project, she uses experimental and quantitative methodology to investigate the behavior of definite descriptions and demonstrative expressions in anaphoric contexts in order to understand the core building blocks of definiteness in Language.|ankana.jpeg|alt=Ankana, an Indian woman with glasses and brown curly hair wearing a hooded coat, smiles
current | Hande Sevgi |Graduate Student|Hande is a graduate student in the Linguistics Department. She mainly works on sign languages, especially on the morphosyntactic constructions such as classifiers. She is also interested in the semantic side of these constructions, while trying to explore their iconicity component. For future studies, she aims to focus on iconicity in spoken languages. She is also interested in investigating the manual and nonmanual co-speech gestures in spoken languages. Previously she worked on the age of acquisition effects on signers of Turkish Sign Language.|hande.jpg|alt=Hande, a woman with long brown hair wearing a ruffled pink shirt, smiling on the Brooklyn bridge
collab | Masashi Tamura |Graduate student, Gallaudet Linguistics|Masashi is a PhD student in linguistics specializing in multimodality, with a focus on both sign languages and spoken languages. Research explores multiple structures of syntactic language and the interactions among various linguistic forms.|masashi.jpg|alt=Masashi, a Japanese man with dark hair and a beard standing in front of a lake and green mountains.
current | Natasha Thalluri |Graduate Student|Natasha is a third year graduate student at the department of Linguistics. She is primarily interested in topics in semantics and at the syntax-semantics interface. Her current project focuses on expressions of gradability in sign languages and their interaction with iconicity. |natasha.jpg|alt=Natasha, a woman with long dark hair in a braid and glasses wearing a pink shirt and green sweater, smiles
current | Anastasia Tsilia |Graduate student, MIT|Anastasia is a graduate student of Linguistics at MIT, who is interested in the semantics and pragmatics of co-speech gestures. She is currently working on a project with Kathryn Davidson, focusing on whether co-speech gestures can license complement anaphora (e.g., Few students came. They (=the ones who did not come) stayed home) with positive quantifiers like ‘most’.|anastasia.jpeg|alt=Anastasia, a white woman with long brown hair, smiles

She has worked on presupposition projection of disjunction and contrastive inference of nominal modification. In addition to linguistics, she also has a background in philosophical logic.|yiqian.jpg|alt=Yiqian, a woman with glasses and short black hair wearing a black shirt in front of a body of water and trees
