Welcome Tory! | 08/20/2025 | We’re thrilled to officially welcome Tory Sampson to the lab as a postdoctoral researcher! Tory’s work studies language change and grammaticalization in the world’s sign languages from both diachronic and synchronic perspectives. She joins us from Boston University where she has been a postdoctoral scholar in the Speech, Language & Hearing Sciences program, and before that from her PhD in Linguistics at UC San Diego. Welcome, Tory!| tory.jpg | alt=
